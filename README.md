# My zsh and vim configs
A repo containing my zshrc and vimrc files. I took the idea from [him](https://gitlab.com/gabrielfortinleblanc/linux-config).
## vim
In order to manage my plugins I use [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). The repo for vundle has a detailed procedure which you can find [here](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim#quick-start). The package that requires special installation is [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe). Some additional installs are required click [here](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe#installation) for more details!

## zsh
I use zsh as my shell and use [ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) to manage configs
